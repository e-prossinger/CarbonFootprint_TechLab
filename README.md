# [Picturing Carbon Footprints](https://techlabs-ms.framer.website/projects/picturing-carbon-footprints)

This repository contains the data analysis and modelling code for the data science project "Picturing Carbon Footprints" developed at TechLabs that estimates and visualizes individual carbon footprints, see the [blog post](https://techlabs-ms.framer.website/projects/picturing-carbon-footprints) for details.
The project includes various machine learning models trained on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dumanmesut/individual-carbon-footprint-calculation), along with an [interactive web application](https://carbonfeet.streamlit.app) built with Streamlit that provides data visualizations and allows users to explore model predictions.
